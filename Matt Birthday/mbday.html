    <h3>I wanna start by saying you were the best brother I could've asked for on this trip, Matt. I was anorexic and really struggling, I remember we dedicated this trip to healing, tearing up typing this but even you have no idea how much I appreciate the little things you did for me that week. Like going to InNOut and taking into account how big of a deal it was for me to eat that burger without breaking down. We pushed the limits and I appreciate you for all of it more than words can mean. Getting those playa bowls with me, crumbl, all of it. I wanted to say on here that I'm so sorry for that day that I didn't eat on that trip. I was so filled with regret. I could tell by your voice when I told you I couldn't that it broke your heart. But you didn't force me, and you understood. By the end of it, I felt like I was finally starting to be okay again, and I can thank you for that. You saw me in this really dark place and you did everything to help, and if that's not brotherly love I dont know what is. The definition of this trip to me is healing, but also fun. So much fun with you. And it's beautiful because now I can type this 3 years later and say I'm at the best place in my life right now with everything, I couldn't have a better relationship with food, my friends, all of our family, and more importantly today; you. I love you for this trip, you did this for me because you knew I needed it. ‚ù§Ô∏è  </h3>

    <h3>Mom's Note to you <3</h3>
    <p><strong>Please take a few minutes and remember how many incredible moments you have had in these 27 years! I am so proud of you and I hope you find a few minutes to be proud of yourself too.
I wish I could relive so many of these moments with you, but they will always be in my heart, and yours too. Happy Birthday Matty! Thank you for being born. Love Mom XOXO</p></strong>
    <h3>Dad's Note to you <3</h3>
    <p><strong>I remember all kinds of fun things with Matt.  Going camping and then canoeing.  Traveling to neat places: San Diego, Colorado, Florida, the shore in lots of ways, South Dakota and most of all Alaska where we saw so much.  I've been privileged to be with him in all kinds of great transitional moments and have been proud of him in so many ways.  An awesome young man!</strong></p>
    <h3>Bert's Note to you <3</h3>
    <p><strong>Matt you have been an inspiration to me. I‚Äôm so proud of you. And everything you‚Äôre doing, you working really hard towards your goals. I‚Äôm very lucky to see you on your journey. I love you Matt. I can‚Äôt to see what you do next!</strong></p>
    <h3>My Note to you <3</h3>
    <p><strong>Oh Matthew, where do I even start? I made this website for you because I need you to know how much not only me, but everyone around you, appreciates you. I think back to all of those movie nights with you as a kid, all of the shows we've watched together, all of the trips we've went on, listening to Owl City, all of those heat remixes, Mac Miller and Grateful Dead with you, It's uncountable the amount of beautiful memories we've shared. I know you don't really like your birthday that much and you get sad, which is why I wanted to do something really special for you. Because if anyone deserves it; It's you. Love you bro, I hope you have a good day today man. I treasure everything more than you'll ever know. Thanks for being not only the best big brother ever, but the best role model too.</strong></p>
